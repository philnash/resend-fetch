# ðŸ“§ Resend Fetch ðŸ“§

This is a module that uses `fetch` to make requests to the [Resend API](https://resend.com/). The intention is to support platforms that support web platform features like `fetch` but do not have Node.js APIs like `http`, like [Deno](https://deno.land/) or [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).

It is written in Deno and will be transpiled to JavaScript. It is intended to work in a similar method to the [Resend Node module](https://github.com/resendlabs/resend-node), though there are expected to be slight differences.
